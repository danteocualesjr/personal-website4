Every writer's journey begins with imitation. We read voraciously, absorbing styles and techniques from authors we admire. We try on different voices like costumes, seeing which ones fit. This is natural, even necessary—how else would we learn?

But at some point, imitation must give way to something else. We must find our own voice.

## What Is a Writer's Voice?

Voice is one of those slippery concepts that's easier to recognize than define. It's the distinctive way you put words together, the rhythm of your sentences, the particular lens through which you see the world. It's what makes a reader say, "This sounds like *you*."

Voice isn't just style, though style is part of it. Voice runs deeper. It's connected to:

- **Your worldview**: What do you believe about people, about life, about the nature of things?
- **Your obsessions**: What questions keep you up at night? What themes draw you back again and again?
- **Your background**: Where you came from, what you've experienced, what languages and cultures have shaped you.

## The Myth of Finding Your Voice

Here's the thing nobody tells you: you don't really "find" your voice. It's not lost. It's not hiding in some cave waiting to be discovered. Your voice is already there, buried under layers of imitation and self-doubt.

The work isn't finding your voice—it's *uncovering* it. It's peeling back the layers of who you think you should sound like to reveal who you actually are on the page.

## Practical Steps

So how do you uncover your voice? Here are some things that have helped me:

### Write Fast, Edit Slow

When you write quickly, you bypass your inner editor—that voice telling you to sound smarter, more literary, more like your favorite authors. Fast writing reveals your natural rhythms.

### Read Widely, Then Stop Reading

Read everything you can. Then, when you sit down to write, stop. Don't have a book open next to you. Don't try to channel anyone. Just write.

### Pay Attention to What Excites You

Notice which sentences make you feel alive when you write them. Those are clues. Follow them.

### Write What Scares You

Your voice often hides in the places you're afraid to go. The topics that feel too personal, too risky, too *you*—that's where your authentic voice lives.

## A Final Thought

Finding your voice isn't a one-time achievement. It's an ongoing practice. Your voice will evolve as you evolve. The writer you are at 30 won't sound exactly like the writer you are at 50, and that's as it should be.

The goal isn't to arrive at some perfect, final voice. The goal is to keep writing honestly, to keep peeling back the layers, to keep getting closer to the truth of who you are on the page.

That's all any of us can do.
