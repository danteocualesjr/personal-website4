There's something about the turn of the year that invites reflection. Not the forced optimism of resolutions—I've given those up—but a quieter kind of taking stock. What stories do I want to tell this year? What am I leaving behind, and what am I carrying forward?

## Looking Back

Last year was a year of finishing things. I completed the final draft of *The Silent Observer*, a project that had haunted me for three years. I wrote more short stories than in any previous year. I started this blog.

Not everything went according to plan. The novel I expected to start in October is still just a collection of notes and half-formed ideas. Some stories I thought would work just... didn't. That's okay. Part of the creative life is learning which projects have legs and which ones don't.

## What I Learned

A few lessons from the past year:

**Deadlines help.** Not arbitrary ones, but real commitments—to editors, to writing groups, to readers. Without external accountability, I drift.

**Perfectionism kills.** I spent too long polishing stories that needed to be released into the world. At some point, you have to let go.

**Reading fuels writing.** The months where I read the most were also the months where I wrote the best. Input and output are connected.

**Community matters.** Writing is solitary, but I can't do it in complete isolation. The writers I connected with this year made the work possible.

## Looking Forward

Here's what I'm thinking about for the year ahead:

### Projects

I have a novel that's been gestating for two years. This is the year it gets written. Not outlined endlessly, not researched to death—written. A rough draft by summer is the goal.

I also want to experiment with shorter forms. Flash fiction, prose poems, things I can complete in a single sitting. There's something freeing about small projects.

### Process

I'm going to be more protective of my morning writing time. It's too easy to let other things creep in—checking email, responding to messages. The morning is for deep work. Everything else can wait.

### Publishing

This year, I want to send more work out into the world. Not just novels and books, but essays, stories, thoughts. This blog is part of that. So is submitting more actively to journals and magazines.

## The Stories We Tell Ourselves

Here's the thing about new years: they're arbitrary. There's nothing magical about January 1st. But there's value in the story we tell ourselves—that this is a new chapter, a fresh start, a chance to do things differently.

The stories we tell ourselves matter. They shape what we believe is possible. If I tell myself this is the year I finally write that novel, maybe—just maybe—I'll actually do it.

So here's to new stories. The ones we write and the ones we live. May they be messy and imperfect and utterly, beautifully ours.

Happy New Year.
