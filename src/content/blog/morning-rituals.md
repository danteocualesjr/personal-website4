For years, I tried to fit my writing around everything else. I'd squeeze it into lunch breaks, stay up late, write on weekends when I could. The result? Inconsistent output and constant frustration.

Everything changed when I committed to mornings.

## Why Mornings Matter

There's a reason so many writers are morning people. It's not that we're naturally early risers—many of us aren't. It's that mornings offer something precious: uninterrupted time before the world starts demanding things from you.

In the morning, your willpower is fresh. Your mind hasn't yet been cluttered with emails, news, decisions. You're closer to the dream state, where ideas flow more freely.

## My Morning Routine

I'm not going to pretend I leap out of bed at 5 AM brimming with enthusiasm. Here's what actually happens:

### 5:30 AM - Wake Up

My alarm goes off. I lie there for exactly five minutes, resisting the urge to check my phone. This is crucial—the moment I look at a screen, I lose the quiet.

### 5:35 AM - Movement

I don't call it exercise because that sounds too ambitious. I stretch. I do a few sun salutations. Sometimes I walk around the block. The point is to get blood flowing without exhausting myself.

### 6:00 AM - Coffee and Silence

I make coffee. I don't turn on music, podcasts, or news. I sit with the quiet and my own thoughts. Sometimes I journal for a few minutes. Often I just stare out the window.

### 6:15 AM - Write

This is the sacred time. I write for 90 minutes to two hours. No email, no phone, no interruptions. I work on whatever project is most important—usually my fiction.

### 8:00 AM - Done

By eight, I've done my most important creative work for the day. Whatever else happens, I've shown up for my writing.

## The Key Principles

What I've learned isn't about the specific times. It's about these principles:

**Protect your creative energy.** Don't spend it on other people's demands before using it for your own work.

**Remove friction.** I set out my notebook the night before. I know exactly what I'm working on. There's nothing to decide in the morning—I just sit down and begin.

**Embrace imperfection.** Some mornings I write garbage. That's okay. The point is to show up. The good days make up for the bad.

**Be consistent.** I write every morning, even weekends, even when I don't feel like it. Motivation follows action, not the other way around.

## What About Night Owls?

Maybe mornings don't work for you. That's fine. The principle still applies: protect your peak creative hours. Figure out when you do your best work and defend that time ruthlessly.

For some writers, it's late night when the house is quiet. For others, it's afternoon. The key is knowing your rhythms and respecting them.

## Start Small

If you're not a morning person, don't try to transform overnight. Start by waking up 30 minutes earlier. Use that time just for writing—nothing else. See how it feels.

After a few weeks, you might find yourself waking up looking forward to that quiet time. Or you might discover mornings aren't for you. Either way, you'll have learned something valuable about how you work best.

The goal isn't to copy someone else's routine. The goal is to create the conditions where your best work can emerge.
