The lighthouse had been automated for thirty years, but Eleanor still climbed the one hundred and twelve steps each evening. Her knees protested. Her breath came harder than it used to. But she climbed.

The authorities had stopped coming years ago. The coast guard cutter that once made monthly visits now passed without slowing, a distant shape on the grey horizon. The lighthouse was no longer on any map that mattered.

But Eleanor climbed.

At the top, she would stand before the great lens—a first-order Fresnel, still magnificent despite the years—and watch the mechanism turn. The light swept across the water in its ancient rhythm: three seconds on, three seconds off. A heartbeat of illumination against the encroaching dark.

"No ships tonight," she would say to no one, her voice thin in the salt-weathered room. "No ships any night."

This was true. The shipping lanes had moved decades ago. The rocks that had once claimed vessels by the dozen now guarded nothing but memory. Eleanor's vigil was a ceremony without congregation, a ritual whose meaning had dissolved into habit.

And yet.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, carried by a young man in a government uniform who looked at Eleanor as if she were a ghost. Perhaps, she thought, she was.

"Ma'am," he said, clutching the envelope like a shield, "I'm here to inform you that the lighthouse is being decommissioned. Permanently."

Eleanor took the envelope without opening it. She knew what it said. The words had been coming for years, carried on the wind, in the silences between radio broadcasts, in the way the maintenance crews had stopped arriving.

"The light," she said.

"Will be turned off," the young man confirmed. "The structure will be preserved as a historical site. You'll need to vacate by the end of the month."

He looked around the keeper's cottage—at the worn furniture, the books stacked in towers, the collection of sea glass arranged on every surface. At the life she had built in this forgotten place.

"Is there somewhere you can go?" he asked. "Family?"

Eleanor thought of her daughter in the city, of the spare bedroom that smelled of air freshener, of the grandchildren who looked at her like she was a story from another century.

"Yes," she lied. "I have somewhere."

That night, Eleanor climbed the stairs slowly, counting each one as she had done every evening for forty-three years. The number never changed, but she counted anyway. Some rituals require precision.

At the top, she pressed her palm against the glass of the lens. The mechanism hummed beneath her touch—old gears doing old work.

"They're turning you off," she said to the light. "They say you're not needed anymore."

The light swept on. Three seconds on. Three seconds off.

Eleanor sat in the keeper's chair, the one her father had occupied before her, the one her grandfather had occupied before him. Three generations of keepers, watching a light that guided ships safely past rocks that wanted to devour them.

"What happens to a lighthouse when there are no more ships?" she asked the darkness. "What happens to a keeper when there's nothing left to keep?"

The light had no answer. It only turned, and turned, and turned.

The night before the officials were due to arrive, Eleanor made her decision.

She climbed the stairs one final time, her joints screaming in protest, her lungs burning with the effort. But she climbed. She had always climbed.

At the top, she opened the small door that led to the gallery—the narrow walkway that circled the light room, exposed to the elements. The wind hit her like a wall, carrying salt and memory and the cries of seabirds long since departed for warmer coasts.

Eleanor gripped the railing and looked out at the sea.

It was black tonight, the water indistinguishable from the sky. No moon, no stars, no distant lights of ships. Just darkness, stretching to the horizon and beyond.

Behind her, the light swept its eternal arc. Illuminating nothing. Guiding no one.

And yet.

Far below, where the rocks met the water in their eternal collision, Eleanor saw something. A shape. A movement.

She squinted into the darkness, her old eyes straining. There—caught between two rocks, barely visible in the light's brief passage—a small boat. Overturned. And beside it, a figure clinging to the stone.

Eleanor's heart stopped. Then started again, racing.

"Hold on," she whispered. Then, louder, into the wind: "Hold on!"

The coast guard found them both at dawn—Eleanor on the rocks, soaked and shivering, her arms around a young man who couldn't stop crying.

"The light," he kept saying through chattering teeth. "I saw the light. I followed it. I thought—I thought there was no one. I thought I was going to die."

Eleanor held him tighter. Her bones ached. Her lungs felt full of water. She had never been so cold, so exhausted, so alive.

"There was someone," she said. "There is always someone."

---

They didn't turn off the light.

The newspapers picked up the story—"Last Lighthouse Keeper Saves Sailor's Life"—and suddenly everyone remembered that the lighthouse existed. Donations poured in. Volunteers appeared. The government, embarrassed, reversed its decision.

Eleanor became something she had never wanted to be: famous. People came from all over to meet the old woman who had climbed down treacherous rocks in the dark to save a stranger. They asked her why she had done it. Why she had risked her life for someone she didn't know.

"Because the light was still on," she would say. "Because it was my job to keep it on."

They didn't understand. They thought it was about duty, about tradition, about some old-fashioned sense of obligation.

But Eleanor knew the truth.

The light wasn't there to guide ships. Not anymore, maybe not ever. The light was there to say: *Someone is here. Someone is watching. You are not alone in the darkness.*

Every night, somewhere in the world, someone was lost. Adrift in black waters, clinging to rocks, searching the horizon for any sign that they hadn't been forgotten.

The light was for them.

Eleanor lived another seven years. She climbed the stairs every evening until the very end, though toward the last she needed help. Her daughter moved into the keeper's cottage. Her grandchildren learned to count the steps: one hundred and twelve, always one hundred and twelve.

When she finally passed, it was peaceful. She closed her eyes in the keeper's chair, listening to the hum of the mechanism, watching the light sweep across the water.

Three seconds on. Three seconds off.

The lighthouse stands still. It is a museum now, a historical site, a place for tourists to climb and take photographs. But the light still works. It turns every night, automated now but faithful to its ancient rhythm.

And sometimes, late in the evening, the docents will tell visitors that they hear footsteps on the stairs. One hundred and twelve steps, counted slowly, as if by someone with old knees and older memories.

They say it's just the wind. The settling of the building. The sounds that old structures make.

But the visitors who stay until dark, who watch the light begin its nightly vigil, sometimes see something else. A shape in the light room. A figure in the keeper's chair.

Watching.

Waiting.

Keeping the light.
